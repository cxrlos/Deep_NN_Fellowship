The move harks back to the Antonio Conte era, the start of this dominant run that has them eyeing a tenth straight Serie A title this season. The three central defenders, at least initially, will be Merih Demiral, Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini, awaiting the return of Matthjis De Ligt by the end of October as he recovers from surgery.')
